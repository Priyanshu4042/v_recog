# Eagle Model File

To use this voice identification application, you need to download the Eagle model file.

## How to get the Eagle model:

1. Sign up for a free Picovoice account at https://console.picovoice.ai/
2. Go to the Eagle section in your dashboard
3. Download the Eagle model file (.pv file)
4. Place the downloaded model file in this directory and rename it to `eagle_params.pv`

## Alternative (for development):

You can also download the model directly from Picovoice's GitHub repository:
https://github.com/Picovoice/eagle/tree/main/lib/common

Make sure to place the model file as: `public/models/eagle_params.pv`

**Note**: The application will not work without this model file!
